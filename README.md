# Hephaestus

Hephaestus is OpenAPI for microservices, but instead of only documenting your http routes, it helps you to manage all your microservices ecosystem.

It follows an _schema-first_ approach, of instead of writing your code first, you write an schema, and it generates most of the code for you.

The schema is designed for **Event-Oriented, Domain-Driven, Decoupled MicroServices, with a Delivery-Usecase-Repository architecture and SQL Databases**, it still can be used for monoliths and other types of architectures, but we don't maintain the schema to be extremely flexible and a silver bullet for all the projects. Or goal here **IS NOT** to allow creativity, is to have a way to create scalable, secure and maintainable applications.

## Why use Hephaestus

In large organizations, we usually have hundreds of micro-services, teams, events, packages, new team members and it's very hard and demanding to maintain everything. Besides that, keeping the things as they are is the basic, we also need to create new things.

In these extremely big environments, it's hard to keep everyone in the same page, to know when you need to update something, to coordinate teams and get the best outcome from your developers.

Hephaestus will help you to:
- Need less developers to accomplish the same (probably even best) results
- Decrease the amount of time that it takes to create new products and features, without having to compromise the quality and security of the software
- Better divide the responsibilities of your team, to get the best that they can offer and not needing so many experienced developers to create amazing products

## How Hephaestus does these things?

- _Schema-first_ approaches help you to visualize the current state of your system in a very easy and fast way: Instead of having to understand code, the project pattern, searching in a bunch of files, go directly to the ONE file definition anf figure it out right away.
- Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, you can follow a standardized architecture that is scalable, clean, flexible, follows the best practices and allows the work to be divided in multiple steps that can be executed in parallel
- Standardize all you micro-services to follow the exact same patterns for EVERYTHING, decreasing a lot the learning curve and the effort necessary to maintain them
- Allows tracking and usage of confidential and private data, like user's emails, to complain with regulations
- Automatically generates e2e tests, the most important tests, extremely useful for early stage startups that can't afford a QA or have enough time to implement more complex tests
- Automatically generates `.proto` files for gRPC APIs and OpenAPI specs for REST APIs
- Generate database migrations and automatically handle them, begin able to easily see the current state of your database by looking at the schema file
- Generate standardized clients for your APIs, with automatically generate `CHANGELOG.md`s that follows [SemVer](https://semver.org)
- Allows for external plugins that allow for integration with other tools like Jira, Linear, Slack or your own custom system

## How Hephaestus work

Hephaestus has 4 main parts, each one responsible for a specific complementary role.

### `*.hpt` files

The schema definition is a `.hpt` file that describes a domain of your service. Each project (micro-service) can have multiple domains in it, and they can be related or not (ideally, they should be).

Think about the `.hpt` files like a `schema.prisma` or an OpenApi spec, and from this we generate an infinity of things.

### `.hephaestusconfig`

`.hephaestusconfig` is the configuration file for Hephaestus, where you put informations like the plugins that you are using, the things that you want to generate, and any other configuration that Hephaestus CLI or the plugins may need.

It is written in [TOML](https://toml.io/en/).

### CLI

The CLI is the way that you interact with all Hephaestus things. You can use it to validate your files, generate things, install plugins, run your migrations, and much more.

It's designed to work with CI/CD too ðŸ™Œ

### Plugins

Plugins allows you to customize Hephaestus as you want. We create the standard, you customize it to attend your needs.

We created some plugins that can be used by anyone independent of the project pattern that they are using, and some specific plugins that fit our needs, but that you can use too.

## F.A.Q.

### Is Hephaestus a silver bullet for every project?

No. We are very clear that Hephaestus is focused on **Event-Oriented, Domain-Driven, Decoupled MicroServices, with a Delivery-Usecase-Repository architecture and SQL Databases**. It may be used in other cases, but we don't give support for these other cases.

### Can Hephaestus be used for monoliths?

Sure, it probably will work great with monoliths too, since they kinda are "big micro-services", we don't guarantee that it will be perfect, but for sure it will help.

### Can Hephaestus be used with NoSql databases?

You kinda can if you have the right plugin, but the schema is not and will not be designed for the specific needs that a NoSql database have. If you want to use a NoSql database as a SQL database, Hephaestus will probably fit your needs.

## Meaning

- Domain: Name of the domain being documented
- Relationships: The relationships that your domain have with other domains and micro-services
- Types: Generic types to be used as Input or Output for `Repository` and `Usecase` methods
- Enums: Enums to be used as types for `Entity`, `Events` and `Repository` and `Usecase` methods
- Entities: Tables on your database
- Repository: The way that you communicate with the tables on your database
- Events: Events emitted by this domain
- Usecase: Where all the business logic stays, has the methods to be used by the consumers through delivery methods
- Delivery: General config for delivery methods

## Recommended Confidentiality Levels

- Low: Can be accessed by anyone with access to the service, can be logged and send in events
- Medium: Can only be accessed by services with special permission, cannot be logged or send in events
- High: Can only be accessed inside the domain, cannot be accessed by other services, logged or send in events
